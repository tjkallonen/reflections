When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When working with others or when wanting to create another copy online.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    To maker sure I know when things have changed

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Clone copies a repository. Fork is a github version of clone. Branch creates kind of another version of repository. 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    You can see what others have done even if you are not merging right now

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Send files or share urls of computers

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    When I am working with something I do not want to publish immediately
